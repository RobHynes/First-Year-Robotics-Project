# First-Year-Robotics-Project
NUIG Electronic and Computer Engineering Robotics Project

Robotics project using the Arduino IDE and pololu 3pi robot to complete a course of 3 challenges.
Locating a light source using LDRs, following a line of black tape using IR sensors, balancing on a seesaw using gyroscope.

Test scripts for each individaul challenge.
Scripts for sensor calibration.
